    <p class="p2smtxt">Dear ma'am, I really feel bad about the fact that I will be leaving this year and you will be leaving as well, So I will not be able to learn from you. The time I had learning from you was honestly the best time I had in this school. I, actually was about to leave in the start of 8th grade itself, however, I stayed back in schhol hoping you would teach us, because at that time there were rumors of the fact that you might teach one division of 8th grade. </p>
    <p>________________________</p>
    <p> I learnt so much with you here that I actually have started to develop an interest in reading! Honestly, I never liked books too much, but now I try to finish a book a week! </p>
    <p>________________________</p>
    <p> I admire you a lot as a teacher, as well as a kind person, as along with being a strict teacher, you are a very calm, understanding and cheerful person! </p>
    <p>________________________</p>
    <p> From the bottom of my heart, I wish that you get the best and you are happy in life, and you have the strength to face any hardships in life. I really hope you keep teaching many other students, and make everyone happy with your presence! You're the best! </p>
    <p>________________________</p>
    <p> I really hope I get the privilege of learning form you again, and I really hope to see you again!</p>
